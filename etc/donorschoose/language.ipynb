    "# Replicating Mitra and Gilbert (2014) Using `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `sklearn`\n",
    "\n",
    "[Tanushree Mitra](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~tmitra3/) and [Eric Gilbert](http://eegilbert.org/) published a paper at CSCW 2014 called _[The Language that Gets People to Give: Phrases that Predict Success on Kickstarter](https://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw14.crowdfunding.mitra.pdf)_. It's a very interesting paper that uses text analysis to find phrases that predict funding success on the crowdfunding site [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/). I thought it would be interesting to apply their methods to a different type of crowdfunding site, [DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/), where people can donate to teachers to support classroom projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to applying their method to a new dataset, I thought I'd do so in a jupyter notebook and walk through some of the Python libraries I'm using to do this project. In doing so, I hope to demonstrate the utility of scientific Python libraries to researchers in HCI and related fields. My intended audience here is people who have some background in Python and have possibly fit a model or two in R before, but don't know a lot about the scientific Python landscape. My goal is to introduce people to loading data in `pandas`, fitting models in `statsmodels`, and doing some basic machine learning with `sklearn`. I'm also assuming you read the paper and mostly understood it, so I won't go into much detail about what things like _bag of words_ representation means, but I'll link to articles if you need a refresher.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to scientific computing in Python, I recommend you check out the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution, which will get you all the libraries that are used below. It will also install jupyter, which means you can [clone this notebook](https://github.com/matthewheston/matthewheston.github.io/tree/master/etc/donorschoose), open it up on your machine, and run all this code at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note_: While I wanted to make this a jupyter notebook with the intention of you being able to easily clone and run on your own machine, in practice, you're going to need a lot of RAM to run some of the models. I was still able to run the sections up to the `sklearn` section on my laptop."

    "[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) describes itself as \"an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.\" We'll be storing all of our data in pandas `DataFrame` objects. It's convention to import this library as `pd`. We also use the `set_option` function to set the number of maximum columns displayed when we peek at a `DataFrame`. We'll set this to a high number so things don't get truncated when we look at them."

You can read more about the data [on their website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose/data). They provide several CSV files. The first has general information about projects. The second has outcome variables (including whether or not a project reached its funding goal), and the last includes both short descriptions as well as the longer essays teachers upload with their projects (which is what we'll be analyzing). pandas offers a nice `read_csv` method to read csv files into a `DataFrame`."

    "The dependent variable in our model will be `fully_funded`: whether or not a project reached its funding goal. In the CSV provided, this takes on the value of either `f` or `t` for false or true. `statsmodels` will expect this to be represent as 0's and 1's. There are different ways you could do this. We'll use the `LabelEndoder` from the library `sklearn`. The purpose of this class is to transform labels into numeric values, which is exactly what we want to do here. Since 'f' comes before 't' alphabetically, it will automatically assign 'f' to 0 and 't' to 1. We'll store these 0's and 1's in a new column on our DataFrame called `y`. We'll do this by simply assigning `all_projects[\"y\"]` the output of `le.fit_transform(all_projects.fully_funded)`. We'll take a look at the first 5 values of these columns to make sure this worked as we expected."

We can get these by calling `values` on the `DataFrame` objects, i.e., calling `X.values`. Also note the line `c, r = y.shape`. The short explanation of this is `sklearn` expects our `y` variable to be in a different shape than what is returned when we called `values` on the variable, so we need to call `reshape` for it to run correctly.

    "Unlike in Mitra and Gilbert's paper, we don't see a decline in the error rate with the introduction of phrases from the essays. In other words, the predictive power of our model did not increase by including the word features. If our goal is just to build a better prediction model, we could experiment with other types of features and use the `cross_val_score` function to evaluate these different models. The nice thing about `sklearn` is it's easy to adjust arguments in functions to try out different features. If we wanted to use a bigger vocabulary, and not look at words and phrases that only appear in all of the subject focus areas, we could simply change the `min_df` argument in our first use of a `CountVectorizer` to build a vocabulary. If we want to only look at unigrams and bigrams, we can change the `ngram_range` to `(1,2)` rather than `(1,3)`. The `LogisticRegression` class also takes different arguments. We have a class imbalance in our dataset of funded and not funded projects. In other words, we have more funded projects than projects that aren't funded. If we wanted to automatically adjust weights in our model based on the proportion of classes, we could pass the argument `class_weight='balanced'` to the `LogisticRegression` class. `sklearn` gives you the option of trying different parameters to see what the best performing model is through [grid search](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html). For now, I'll just focus on how to take the results of our current model and explore the phrases and export a dataset similar to the one Mitra and Gilbert published.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll call `classifier.fit`. This will simply fit a model using all our features. We can get the phrases we used from `CountVectorizer` by calling `get_feature_names()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore these phrases and which ones were most predictive of funded projects and which were predictive of non funded projects, we'll use the coefficients associated with each phrase in our model. These are accessible via the `coef_` attribute of our classifier model. To sort the coefficients, we'll use the `argsort` function from `numpy`. This function takes in an array and returns an array of the indices of the sorted values of the input array. For example, if we call `np.argsort(np.array([3, 1, 2])`, it would return `[1, 2, 0]`, because the lowest value has index 1 in the input array, the next highest value had index 2, and the highest value has index 0. By default, `argsort` will return values from lowest to highest. If we want to go from highest to lowest, we can reverse the array using the index `[::-1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can simply loop through the sorted coefficients and write them out to a tab separated file. I also print out the top 5 most predictive phrases for funded and non funded projects. Remember that not all of our features were our phrases, we also included variables such like `school_metro`. Since these variables won't have any variables in our `feature_names` variable, we'll use the condition statement `if coef_pos < word_features.shape[1]` before trying to write out any features. In other words, we make sure that the coefficient we're looking at is one of our word features and not one of the other variables before trying to look it up in our `feature_names` array. The resulting betas.csv file is available [in this repository](https://github.com/matthewheston/matthewheston.github.io/tree/master/etc/donorschoose)."
