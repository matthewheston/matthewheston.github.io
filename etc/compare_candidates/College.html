<h1>Hillary</h1><font color = #A9A9AD>The New College Compact: 

Costs won’t be a barrier, debt won’t hold you back.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>“We need to make a quality education affordable and available to everyone willing to work for it, without saddling them with decades of debt.”

Hillary has a vision for America in which education is attainable for all.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>The New College Compact will ensure that costs aren’t a barrier to college and that debt doesn’t hold Americans back.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>How will Hillary’s plan help you?</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Take the quiz to find out.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Here’s what every student and family should expect under Hillary’s plan: 





Students should never have to borrow to pay for tuition, books, and fees to attend a four-year public college in their state under the New College Compact.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Pell Grants are not included in the calculation of no-debt-tuition, so Pell recipients will be able to use their grants fully for living expenses.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Students at community college will receive free tuition.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Students will do their part by contributing their earnings from working 10 hours a week.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Families will do their part by making an affordable and realistic family contribution.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>The federal government will make a major investment in the New College Compact by providing grants to states that commit to these goals, and by cutting interest rates on loans.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>States will have to step up and meet their obligation to invest in higher education by maintaining current levels of higher education funding and reinvesting over time.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Colleges and universities will be accountable for improving outcomes and controlling costs to ensure that tuition is affordable and that students who invest in college leave with a degree.</font><br /><font color = #545457>We will encourage innovators who design imaginative new ways of providing a valuable college education to students—while cracking down on abusive practices that burden students with debt without value.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>A $25 billion fund will support HBCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs serving a high percentage of Pell Grant recipients to help lower the cost of attendance and improve student outcomes at low-cost, modest-endowment nonprofit private schools.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Under Hillary’s plan, if you have student debt, you will be able to refinance your loans at current rates.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>An estimated 25 million borrowers will receive debt relief, and the typical borrower could save $2,000 over the life of his or her loans.</font><br /><font color = #949497>For future undergraduates, the plan will significantly cut interest rates so they reflect the government’s low cost of debt.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>This could save students hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of their loans.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Everyone will be able to enroll in a simplified, income-based repayment program so that borrowers never have to pay more than 10 percent of what they make.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Fully paid for: This plan will cost around $350 billion over 10 years—and will be fully paid for by limiting certain tax expenditures for high-income taxpayers.

Sanders will prevent the federal government from profiteering on the backs of college students and use this money instead to significantly lower student loan interest rates.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>SUBSTANTIALLY CUT STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Under the Sanders plan, the formula for setting student loan interest rates would go back to where it was in 2006.</font><br /><font color = #949497>If this plan were in effect today, interest rates on undergraduate loans would drop from 4.29% to just 2.37%.</font><br /><font color = #949497>ALLOW AMERICANS TO REFINANCE STUDENT LOANS AT TODAY’S LOW INTEREST RATES.</font><br /><font color = #545457>It makes no sense that you can get an auto loan today with an interest rate of 2.5%, but millions of college graduates are forced to pay interest rates of 5-7% or more for decades.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Under the Sanders plan, Americans would be able to refinance their student loans at today’s low interest rates.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>ALLOW STUDENTS TO USE NEED-BASED FINANCIAL AID AND WORK STUDY PROGRAMS TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>The Sanders plan would require public colleges and universities to meet 100% of the financial needs of the lowest-income students.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Low-income students would be able to use federal, state and college financial aid to cover room and board, books and living expenses.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>And Sanders would more than triple the federal work study program to build valuable career experience that will help them after they graduate.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>FULLY PAID FOR BY IMPOSING A TAX ON WALL STREET SPECULATORS.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>The cost of this $75 billion a year plan is fully paid for by imposing a tax of a fraction of a percent on Wall Street speculators who nearly destroyed the economy seven years ago.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>More than 1,000 economists have endorsed a tax on Wall Street speculation and today some 40 countries throughout the world have imposed a similar tax including Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, and China.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>If the taxpayers of this country could bailout Wall Street in 2008, we can make public colleges and universities tuition free and debt free throughout the country.</font><br />
