streamline identity documents to remove barriers to transgender Americans changing their gender marker on identification documents; and invest in law enforcement training focused on fair and impartial policing, including in interactions with LGBT individuals.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Hillary will invest in law enforcement training that focuses on issues such as implicit bias, use of force, and de-escalation, as well as fair and impartial policing including in their interactions with the LGBT community, in particular transgender individuals.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>It will also focus on educating police officers on correctly identifying bias-motivated crimes.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Promote human rights of LGBT people around the world.</font><br /><font color = #545457>As secretary of state, Hillary stood before the United Nations Human Rights Council and and told the world's leaders, "Gay rights are human rights.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>" Hillary will continue to promote LGBT human rights and ensure America’s foreign policy is inclusive of LGBT people around the world, including increasing our investment in the Global Equality Fund to advance the human rights of LGBT people around the world.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Hillary has spent her life fighting for equality for all, and has been a vocal advocate for LGBT rights throughout her career.</font><br /><font color = #545457>In the U.S. Senate, Hillary championed hate crime legislation, fought for federal non-discrimination legislation to protect LGBT Americans in the workplace, and advocated for an end to restrictions that blocked LGBT Americans from adopting children.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>As secretary of state, Hillary advanced LGBT rights abroad and enforced stronger anti-discrimination regulations within the State Department, declaring on the global stage that “gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.” She led the effort to pass the first-ever U.N.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Resolution on LGBT Human Rights, launched the Global Equality Fund, ended State Department regulations that denied same-sex couples and their families equal rights, helped implement LGBT-friendly workplace policies, and updated the State Department’s policy so that transgender individuals’ passports reflect their true gender.</font><br /><h1>Bernie</h1><font color = #7F7F82>Senator Sanders has been a longtime supporter of LGBT rights.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>In 1983, during his first term as Mayor of Burlington, Sen.
