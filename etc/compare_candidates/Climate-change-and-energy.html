<h1>Hillary</h1><font color = #949497>Making America the world’s clean energy superpower and meeting the climate challenge.</font><br /><font color = #545457>"I won’t let anyone take us backward, deny our economy the benefits of harnessing a clean energy future, or force our children to endure the catastrophe that would result from unchecked climate change.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>"

Climate change is an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time—and Hillary Clinton has a plan to tackle it by making America the world’s clean energy superpower, taking bold steps to slash carbon pollution at home and around the world, and ensuring no Americans are left out or left behind as we rapidly build a clean energy economy.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>2015 was the warmest year on record—and 15 of the 16 hottest years on record have come just since 2001.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Already, American families are seeing the impacts of climate change with their own eyes, from the record drought in California to the frequently flooded streets of Miami and Annapolis.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>While climate deniers continue to ignore settled science because it does not suit their political agenda, and climate defeatists doubt America’s ability to meet this challenge, Hillary knows that America is fully up to the task.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Already, U.S. carbon pollution has been cut to its lowest level since 1995.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Wind power has expanded three fold and solar power 30-fold since 2008.</font><br /><font color = #545457>But that’s not enough to tackle the climate challenge, meet America’s carbon pollution reduction goals, or to compete for the $13.5 trillion of global clean energy investment unlocked by the historic international climate change agreement reached in Paris.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>We can and must go further.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>That’s why on day one, Hillary will set bold, national goals that will be achieved within ten years of her taking office:



 Hillary’s plan is designed to deliver on the pledge President Obama made at the Paris climate conference last December—without relying on climate deniers in Congress to pass new legislation.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Her plan will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 percent in 2025 relative to 2005 levels and put the country on a path to cut emissions more than 80 percent by 2050.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Her approach will catalyze new investment and economic opportunity across the country, create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, reduce energy bills and save families money, make our country more secure, and protect our families and communities from pollution.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Defend, implement, and extend smart pollution and efficiency standards, including the Clean Power Plan, which will prevent 3,600 premature deaths and 90,000 asthma attacks annually, and efficiency standards for cars, trucks and appliances that are already reducing energy costs for American households and businesses by over $75 billion per year.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Launch a $60 billion Clean Energy Challenge to partner with states, cities, and rural communities and give them the tools and resources they need to go beyond federal standards in cutting carbon pollution and expanding clean energy.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>The Clean Energy Challenge will also help ensure all Americans share in the benefits of a clean energy economy by encouraging solar and energy efficiency investments in low-income communities.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Invest in clean energy infrastructure, innovation, manufacturing and workforce development to make the U.S. economy more competitive and create good paying jobs and careers.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Hillary has a comprehensive plan for making existing energy infrastructure cleaner and safer, unlocking new investment, and forging a climate compact with Canada and Mexico to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate clean energy deployment across the continent.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Ensure safe and responsible energy production.</font><br /><font color = #545457>As we transition to a clean energy economy, we must ensure that the fossil fuel production taking place today is safe and responsible and that areas too sensitive for energy production are taken off the table.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Hillary knows there are some places where we should keep fossil fuels in the ground or under the ocean.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Reform leasing on public lands.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>As president, Hillary would reform fossil fuel leasing and significantly expand clean energy production on public lands, from wind in Wyoming to solar in Nevada.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>End wasteful tax subsidies for oil and gas companies.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Oil and gas companies have enjoyed billions in tax breaks for decades.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Hillary would end those wasteful subsidies and invest in clean energy.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Cut methane emissions across the economy.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Hillary would cut emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, by 40-45 percent and put in place strong standards for reducing leaks from both new and existing sources.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Revitalize coal communities.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Building a 21st century clean energy economy will create new jobs and industries, protect public health, and reduce carbon pollution.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>But we can’t ignore the impact this transition is already having on coal communities.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Hillary’s $30 billion plan to revitalize coal communities will ensure coal miners, power plant operators, transportation workers, and their families get the respect they deserve and the benefits they have earned; invest in economic diversification and job creation; and make coal communities an engine of US economic growth in the 21st century, as they have been for generations.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>"In spite of the strongest possible scientific consensus about what climate change means for our environment, economy, health, and future, there are still some who deny the facts.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>They’re intent on obstructing progress.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>We can’t let them win this fight.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>We have no choice.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>There is no Planet B.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>"</font><br /><h1>Bernie</h1><font color = #2A2A2B>The fossil fuel industry spends billions and billions of dollars lobbying and buying candidates to block virtually all progress on climate change.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>At the national level where companies have to report what they spend on lobbying and campaign contributions, the oil companies, coal companies and electric utilities spent a staggering $2.26 billion in federal lobbying since 2009 and another $330 million in federal campaign contributions.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Even in Washington, that’s a lot of money.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>But that’s just the part we know about.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Thanks to the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, the fossil fuel industry can pour unlimited amounts of money into the political system without having to disclose how much or where they spend it.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>So what does the fossil fuel industry get in exchange for all that money?</font><br /><font color = #69696C>They get friends who help them keep $135 billion dollars in tax subsidies and corporate welfare over the next decade.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>They write legislation to build the Keystone XL pipeline.</font><br /><font color = #545457>They block efforts to move us beyond oil by blocking the development and deployment of clean, sustainable energy.</font><br /><font color = #949497>This makes it harder to take action to fight climate change.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>But the solutions are possible.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Together there is nothing we can’t achieve.</font><br />
