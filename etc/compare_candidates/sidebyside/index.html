  Each link below will take you to a page that shows the official issue page from
  both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the given issue side by side. The
  only modification we made to these pages is the color of the text of each
  sentence. We used a machine learning algorithm to determine which sentences on
  these pages do a better job of discriminating between candidates. Darker
  sentences do a better job according to the algorithm, whereas lighter
  sentences do not. The idea is that if someone wants to quickly scross through
  these pages and quickly determine what types of text makes each candidate
  unique, they can skip over less informative sentences.
