<h1><b>Physical Violence</b></h1>
<h4>Perpetrated by the State</h4>
<p><font color = #3F3F41>Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Jessica Hernandez, Tamir Rice, Jonathan Ferrell, Oscar Grant, Antonio Zambrano-Montes, Samuel DuBose and Anastacio Hernandez-Rojas.</font> <font color = #E8E8EE>We know their names.</font> <font color = #949497>Each of them died unarmed at the hands of police officers or in police custody.</font> <font color = #BEBEC3>The chants are growing louder.</font> <font color = #A9A9AD>People are angry and they have a right to be angry.</font> <font color = #A9A9AD>We should not fool ourselves into thinking that this violence only affects those whose names have appeared on TV or in the newspaper.</font> <font color = #2A2A2B><font color = #2A2A2B>African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police.</font></font> <font color = #545457>African-American and Latinos comprise well over half of all prisoners, even though African-Americans and Latinos make up approximately one quarter of the total US population.</font></p>
<h4>Perpetrated by Extremists</h4>
<p><font color = D3D3D8>We are far from eradicating racism in this country.</font> <font color = #949497>Today in America, if you are black, you can be killed for getting a pack of Skittles during a basketball game.</font> <font color = D3D3D8>Or murdered in your church while you are praying.</font> <font color = #BEBEC3>This violence fills us with outrage, disgust and a deep, deep sadness.</font> <font color = D3D3D8>These hateful acts of violence amount to acts of terror.</font> <font color = #2A2A2B>They are perpetrated by extremists who want to intimidate and terrorize black, brown and indigenous people in this country.</font></p>
<h3><b>Addressing Physical Violence</b></h3>
<p><font color = #545457>It is an outrage that in these early years of the 21st century we are seeing intolerable acts of violence being perpetrated by police and racist acts of terrorism by white supremacists.</font></p>
<p><font color = #E8E8EE>A growing number of communities do not trust the police.</font> <font color = #BEBEC3>Law enforcement officers have become disconnected from the communities they are sworn to protect.</font> <font color = #A9A9AD>Violence and brutality of any kind, particularly at the hands of the police meant to protect and serve our communities, is unacceptable and must not be tolerated.</font> <font color = #949497>We need a societal transformation to make it clear that black lives matter and racism will not be accepted in a civilized country.</font></p>
<ul>
<li>We must demilitarize our police forces so they don‚Äôt look and act like invading armies.
</li>
<li>We must invest in community policing. Only when we get officers into the communities, working within neighborhoods before trouble arises, do we develop the relationships necessary to make our communities safer together. Among other things, that means increasing civilian oversight of police departments.
</li>
<li>We must create a police culture that allows for good officers to report the actions of bad officers without fear of retaliation and allows for a department to follow through on such reports.
</li>
<li>We need police forces that reflect the diversity of our communities, including in the training academies and leadership.
</li>
<li>At the federal level, we need to establish a new model police training program that reorients the way we do law enforcement in this country. With input from a broad segment of the community including activists and leaders from civil rights organizations we will reinvent how we police America.
</li>
<li>We need to federally fund and require body cameras for law enforcement officers to make it easier to hold them accountable.
</li>
<li>We need to require police departments and states to collect data on all police shootings and deaths that take place while in police custody and make that data public.
</li>
<li>We need new rules on the allowable use of force. Police officers need to be trained to de-escalate confrontations and to humanely interact with people who have mental illnesses.
</li>
<li>States and localities that make progress in this area should get more federal justice grant money. Those that do not should get their funding slashed.
</li>
<li>We need to make sure federal resources are there to crack down on the illegal activities of hate groups.
</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Political Violence</b></h1>
<h4>Disenfranchisement</h4>
<p><font color = #69696C>In the shameful days of open segregation, literacy laws and poll taxes were used to suppress minority voting.</font> <font color = #545457>Today, through other laws and actions ‚Äî such as requiring voters to show photo ID, discriminatory drawing of Congressional districts, restricting same-day registration and early voting and aggressively purging voter rolls ‚Äî states are taking steps which have a similar effect.</font></p>
<p><font color = #E8E8EE>The patterns are unmistakable.</font> <font color = #545457>11 percent of eligible voters do not have a photo ID‚Äîand they are disproportionately black and Latino.</font> <font color = #7F7F82>In 2012, African-Americans waited twice as long to vote as whites.</font> <font color = #69696C>Some voters in minority precincts waited upwards of six or seven hours to cast a ballot.</font> <font color = #69696C>Meanwhile, thirteen percent of African-American men have lost the right to vote due to felony convictions.</font> </p>
<p>Yet in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the seminal Voting Rights Act, even while saying ‚Äúvoting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.‚Äù</p>
<p>This should offend the conscience of every American.</p>
<p><font color = #E8E8EE>The fight for minority voting rights is a fight for justice.</font> <font color = D3D3D8>It is inseparable from the struggle for democracy itself.</font></p>
<h3><b>Addressing Political Violence</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to re-enfranchise the more than two million African-Americans who have had their right to vote taken away by a felony conviction, paid their debt to society, and deserve to have their rights restored.
</li>
<li>Congress must restore the ‚Äúpre-clearance‚Äù formula under the Voting Rights Act, which extended protections to minority voters in states and counties where they were clearly needed.
</li>
<li>We must expand the Act‚Äôs scope so that every American, regardless of skin color or national origin, is able to vote freely.
</li>
<li>We need to make Election Day a federal holiday to increase voters‚Äô ability to participate.
</li>
<li>We must make early voting an option for voters who work or study and need the flexibility to vote on evenings or weekends.
</li>
<li>We must make no-fault absentee ballots an option for all Americans.
</li>
<li>We must automatically register every American to vote when they turn 18 or move to a new state. The burden of registering voters should be on the state, not the individual voter.
</li>
<li>We must put an end to discriminatory laws and the purging of minority-community names from voting rolls.
</li>
<li>We need to make sure that there are sufficient polling places and poll workers to prevent long lines from forming at the polls anywhere.
</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Legal Violence</b></h1>
<p><font color = #949497>Millions of lives have been destroyed because people are in jail for nonviolent crimes.</font> <font color = #3F3F41>For decades, we have been engaged in a failed ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù with racially-biased mandatory minimums that punish people of color unfairly.</font><br/>
<font color = #A9A9AD>It is an obscenity that we stigmatize so many young Americans with a criminal record for smoking marijuana, but not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.</font> <font color = #E8E8EE>This must change.</font></p>
<p><font color = #2A2A2B>If current trends continue, one in four black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime.</font> <font color = #2A2A2B>Blacks are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites and a report by the Department of Justice found that blacks were three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop, compared to white motorists.</font> <font color = #3F3F41>Together, African-Americans and Latinos comprised 57 percent of all prisoners in 2014, even though African-Americans and Latinos make up approximately one quarter of the US population.</font> <font color = #BEBEC3>These outcomes are not reflective of increased crime by communities of color, but rather a disparity in enforcement and reporting mechanisms.</font> <font color = #2A2A2B><font color = #2A2A2B>African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police.</font></font> <font color = D3D3D8>This is an unspeakable tragedy.</font></p>
<p><font color = #E8E8EE>It is morally repugnant that we have privatized prisons all over America.</font> <font color = #A9A9AD>Corporations should not be allowed to make a profit by building more jails and keeping more Americans behind bars.</font> <font color = #E8E8EE>We have got to end the private for-profit prison racket in America.</font> <font color = #BEBEC3>Earlier this year, Sen. Sanders introduced legislation that will end the private prison industry.</font></p>
<p><font color = #69696C>The measure of success for law enforcement should not be how many people get locked up.</font> <font color = #949497>We need to invest in drug courts as well as medical and mental health interventions for people with substance abuse problems, so that people struggling with addiction do not end up in prison, they end up in treatment.</font></p>
<p><font color = #69696C>For people who have committed crimes that have landed them in jail, there needs to be a path back from prison.</font> <font color = D3D3D8>The federal system of parole needs to be reinstated.</font> <font color = #E8E8EE>We need real education and real skills training for the incarcerated.</font></p>
<p><font color = #E8E8EE>We must end the over-incarceration of nonviolent young Americans who do not pose a serious threat to our society.</font> <font color = #3F3F41>It is an international embarrassment that we have more people locked up in jail than any other country on earth ‚Äì more than even the Communist totalitarian state of China.</font> <font color = #E8E8EE>That has got to end.</font></p>
<p><font color = #545457>We must address the lingering unjust stereotypes that lead to the labeling of black youths as ‚Äúthugs‚Äù and ‚Äúsuper predators.‚Äù We know the truth that, like every community in this country, the vast majority of people of color are trying to work hard, play by the rules and raise their children.</font> <font color = #A9A9AD>It‚Äôs time to stop demonizing minority communities.</font><br/>
<font color = #BEBEC3>In many cities all over our country, the incentives for policing are upside down.</font> <font color = #3F3F41>Departments are bringing in substantial sums of revenue by seizing the personal property of people who are suspected of criminal involvement.</font> <font color = #2A2A2B>So-called civil asset forfeiture laws allow police to take property from people even before they are charged with a crime, much less convicted of one.</font> <font color = #949497>Even worse, the system works in a way that makes it very difficult and expensive for an innocent person to get his or her property back.</font>¬†<font color = #BEBEC3>We must end programs that actually reward officials for seizing assets without a criminal conviction or other lawful mandate.</font> <font color = #7F7F82>Departments and officers should not profit off of such seizures.</font></p>
<p><font color = #949497>Local governments that rely on tickets and fines to pay bills can become dependent on implicit quotas for law enforcement.</font> <font color = #2A2A2B>When policing is a source of revenue tied to the financial sustainability of agencies, officers are pressured to meet internal goals which can lead to unnecessary or unlawful traffic stops and citations which disproportionately affect people of color.</font> <font color = #A9A9AD>Implicit quota systems promote racial stereotyping and breed distrust between officers and communities of color.</font></p>
<p><font color = #69696C>Furthermore, we must ensure police departments are not abusing avenues of due process to shield bad actors from accountability.</font> <font color = #7F7F82>Local governments and police management must show zero tolerance for abuses of police power at all levels.</font> <font color = #7F7F82>All employees of any kind deserve due process protections, but it must be clear that departments will vigorously investigate and, if necessary, prosecute every allegation of wrongdoing to the fullest extent.</font> </p>
<h3><b>Addressing Legal Violence</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to ban prisons for profit, which result in an over-incentive to arrest, jail and detain in order to keep prison beds full.
</li>
<li>We need to turn back from the failed ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù and eliminate mandatory minimums which result in sentencing disparities between black and white people.
</li>
<li>We need to take marijuana off the federal government‚Äôs list of outlawed drugs.
</li>
<li>We need to allow people in states which legalize marijuana to be able to fully participate in the banking system and not be subject to federal prosecution for using pot.
</li>
<li>We need to invest in drug courts and medical and mental health interventions for people with substance abuse problems, so that they do not end up in prison, they end up in treatment.
</li>
<li>We need to boost investments for programs that help people who have gone to jail rebuild their lives with education and job training.</li>
<li>We must investigate local governments that are using implicit or explicit quotas for arrests or stops.
</li>
<li>We must stop local governments that are relying on fines, fees or asset forfeitures as a steady source of revenue.
</li>
<li>Police departments must investigate all allegations of wrongdoing, especially those involving the use of force, and prosecute aggressively, if necessary. If departments are unwilling or unable to conduct such investigations, the Department of Justice must step in and handle it for them.
</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Economic Violence</b></h1>
<p>Weeks before his death, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke to a union group in New York about what he called ‚Äúthe other America.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne America is flowing with the milk of prosperity and the honey of equality,‚Äù King said. ‚ÄúThat America is the habitat of millions of people who have food and material necessities for their bodies, culture and education for their minds, freedom and human dignity for their spirits ‚Ä¶‚ÄâBut as we assemble here tonight, I‚Äôm sure that each of us is painfully aware of the fact that there is another America and that other America has a daily ugliness about it that transforms the buoyancy of hope into the fatigue of despair.‚Äù</p>
<p>The problem was structural, King said: ‚ÄúThis country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.‚Äù</p>
<p>But what King saw in 1968 ‚Äî and what we all should recognize today ‚Äî is that it is necessary to try to address the rampant economic inequality while also taking on the issue of societal racism. <font color = #2A2A2B>We must simultaneously address the structural and institutional racism which exists in this country, while at the same time we vigorously attack the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which is making the very rich much richer while everyone else ‚Äî especially those in our minority communities ‚Äì are becoming poorer.</font></p>
<p><font color = #7F7F82>In addition to the physical violence faced by too many in our country we need to look at the lives of black children and address some difficult facts.</font> <font color = #3F3F41>Black children, who make up just 18 percent of preschoolers, account for 48 percent of all out-of-school suspensions before kindergarten.</font> <font color = #949497>We are failing our black children before kindergarten.</font> <font color = #545457>Black students are expelled at three times the rate of white students.</font> <font color = #7F7F82>Black girls are suspended at higher rates than all other girls and most boys.</font> <font color = #7F7F82>According to the Department of Education, African-American students are more likely to suffer harsh punishments ‚Äî suspensions and arrests ‚Äî at school.</font> <font color = #7F7F82>Black students attend schools with higher concentrations of first-year teachers when compared with white students.</font> <font color = #2A2A2B>Black students are more than three times as likely to attend schools where fewer than 60 percent of teachers meet all state certification and licensure requirements.</font></p>
<p><font color = #BEBEC3>Communities of color also face the violence of economic deprivation.</font> <font color = #949497>Let‚Äôs be frank: neighborhoods like those in west Baltimore, where Freddie Gray resided, suffer the most.</font> <font color = #3F3F41>However, the problem of economic immobility isn‚Äôt just a problem for young men like Freddie Gray.</font> <font color = #A9A9AD>Despite hard-work and the will to get ahead, millions of Americans spend their entire lives struggling to survive on the economic treadmill.</font></p>
<p><font color = #BEBEC3>We live at a time when most Americans have less than $10,000 in savings and millions of working adults have no idea how they will ever retire in dignity.</font> <font color = #A9A9AD>An unforeseen car accident, a medical emergency, or the loss of a job could send their lives into an economic tailspin.</font> <font color = #E8E8EE>And the problems are even more serious when we consider race.</font></p>
<p><font color = #545457>Let us not forget: It was the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street that nearly drove the economy off of a cliff seven years ago.</font> <font color = #69696C>While millions of Americans lost their jobs, homes, life savings and ability to send their kids to college, African-Americans who were steered into expensive subprime mortgages were the hardest hit.</font></p>
<p><font color = #69696C>Most black and Latino households have less than $350 in savings.</font> <font color = #3F3F41>The black unemployment rate has remained roughly twice as high as the white rate over the last 40 years, regardless of education.</font> <font color = #545457>Real African-American youth unemployment is over 50 percent.</font> <font color = #A9A9AD>African-American women earn 64 cents for every dollar white men make.</font> <font color = D3D3D8>This is unacceptable.</font> <font color = #69696C>The American people in general want change ‚Äî they want a better deal.</font> <font color = D3D3D8>A fairer deal.</font> <font color = #BEBEC3>A new deal.</font> <font color = #949497>They want an America with laws and policies that truly reward hard work with economic mobility.</font> <font color = D3D3D8>They want an America that affords all of its citizens with the economic security to take risks and the opportunity to realize their full potential.</font></p>
<h3><b>Addressing Economic Violence</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to give our children, regardless of their race or income, a fair shot at attending college. That‚Äôs why all public universities should be made tuition free. We should pay for that with a tax on Wall Street speculators.
</li>
<li>We must invest $5.5 billion to create 1 million jobs for disadvantaged young Americans who face high unemployment rates and job-training opportunities for hundreds of thousands of young adults. We should pay for that by ending the loophole allowing Wall Street hedge fund managers to pay a lower tax rate than nurses or truck drivers.
</li>
<li>We must increase the minimum wage to a livable wage of $15 an hour by 2020 ‚Äîwhich will increase the wages of about half of African-Americans and nearly 60 percent of Latinos.
</li>
<li>We must invest $1 trillion to put 13 million Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling cities, roads, bridges, public transportation systems, airports, drinking water systems and other infrastructure needs. We should pay for that by closing offshore tax loopholes.
</li>
<li>We must pass federal legislation to ensure pay equity for women.
</li>
<li>We must prevent employers from discriminating against applicants based on criminal history by ‚Äúbanning the box.‚Äù</li>
<li>We must promote policies to give the formerly incarcerated an opportunity for education, including expanding the Second Chance Pell Pilot Program and reentry programs.</li>
<li>We need to ensure access to quality affordable childcare for working families, especially for parents who work non-traditional hours.</li>
<li>We must fundamentally re-write our trade policies and rebuild factories that were closed as a result of bad trade deals.</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>Environmental Violence</b></h1>
<h4>Perpetrated by Polluting Industries</h4>
<p><font color = #3F3F41>People of color disproportionately experience a daily assault on their health and environment.</font> <font color = #69696C>Communities of color are the hardest hit by air and water pollution from industrial factories, power plants, incinerators, chemical waste and lead contamination from old pipes and paint.</font> <font color = #949497>At the same time, they lack access to parks, gardens and other recreational green space.</font></p>
<p><font color = #7F7F82>Like income inequality, environmental inequality is rapidly growing in the United States.</font></p>
<p><font color = #3F3F41>Black children are five times more likely than white children to have lead poisoning.</font> <font color = #545457>Indigenous peoples are impacted disproportionately by destructive mining practices and the dumping of hazardous materials on their lands.</font> <font color = #545457>As demonstrated by Hurricane Katrina, poor communities of color have a harder time escaping, surviving and recovering from climate-related disasters.</font> Taken together, it is clear that people of color experience a disparate exposure to environmental hazards where they ‚Äúwork, live, and play.‚Äù</p>
<p>Nationwide, the health of communities is consistently ignored in favor of the profits of corporate polluters. <font color = #2A2A2B>The fact that people of color breathe 46 percent more nitrogen dioxide ‚Äîwhich causes respiratory diseases and heart conditions ‚Äî than whites helps explain why one in six African-American kids has asthma.</font> </p>
<p><font color = #2A2A2B>The environmental violence being inflicted on people of color who are denied the full rights of citizenship ‚Äî especially migrant workers and new immigrants ‚Äî is especially pronounced.</font> <font color = #7F7F82>Low-income Latino immigrants are more likely to live in areas with high levels of hazardous air pollution than anyone else.</font> <font color = #949497>In fact, the odds of a Latino immigrant neighborhood being located in an area of high toxic pollution is one in three.</font> </p>
<p><font color = #3F3F41>Latinos and African-Americans are more likely to work in hazardous jobs that place them at higher risk for serious occupational diseases, injuries and muscular-skeletal disabilities.</font> <font color = #69696C>The fatality rate among Latino workers is 23 percent higher than the fatal injury rate for all US workers.</font> <font color = #7F7F82>Often reluctant to complain about poor working conditions for fear of deportation or being fired, Mexican migrant workers are nearly twice as likely as the rest of the immigrant population to die at work.</font> <font color = D3D3D8>This is unacceptable and must be addressed.</font></p>
<p><font color = #A9A9AD>Taken together, these injustices are largely the product of political marginalization and institutional racism.</font> <font color = #545457>The less political power a community of color possesses, the more likely they are to experience insidious environmental and human health threats.</font> <font color = #BEBEC3>The environmental violence being inflicted on these communities of color is taking a terrible toll, and must be made a national priority.</font> <font color = D3D3D8>Access to a clean and healthy environment is a fundamental right of citizenship.</font> <font color = D3D3D8>To deny such rights constitutes an environmental injustice that should never be tolerated.</font></p>
<h3><b>Addressing Environmental Violence</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>We must protect low-income and minority communities, who are hit first and worst by the causes and impacts of climate change, while also protecting existing energy-sector workers as they transition into clean energy and other jobs. </li>
<li>We must have equal enforcement of environmental, civil rights and public health laws.</li>
<li>We need to address the inadequate environmental cleanup efforts of Superfund hazardous waste sites in communities of color.
</li>
<li>We must stop the unequal exposure of people of color to harmful chemicals, pesticides and other toxins in homes, schools, neighborhoods and workplaces and challenge faulty assumptions in calculating, assessing and managing risks, discriminatory zoning and land-use practices and exclusionary policies. </li>
<li>Federal agencies must develop and implement clear, strategic plans to achieve climate and environmental justice and provide targeted action where the needs are greatest.
</li>
<li>The environmental analysis for a permit for a polluting facility must consider the disparate and cumulative environmental burden borne by a community.</li>
<li>States should evaluate and report progress made on addressing climate and environmental injustice.
</li>
<li>We need to mitigate climate change and focus on building resilience in low-income and minority communities.
</li>
<li>We must promote cleaner manufacturing processes, renewable energy systems and safe product designs that end pollution and the use of toxic chemicals, while providing safe jobs and other economic benefits for people of color.
