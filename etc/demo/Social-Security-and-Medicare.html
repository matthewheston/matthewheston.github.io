<h1>Hillary</h1><font color = D3D3D8>We must preserve, protect, and strengthen these lifelines.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Throughout her career, Hillary has spoken out for seniors and stood up for Medicare and Social Security, and she is committed to preserving, protecting and strengthening these lifelines for today's seniors and for future generations.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Seniors have paid into these programs for a lifetime, and they've earned those benefits when they retire.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>“Now, I will also defend Social Security and Medicare from the efforts of the Republicans to privatize both of them.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>When I was in the Senate, George Bush came up with a privatization plan.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Some of you might remember that.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>It would have been a disaster.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>And we defeated it.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>As your president, I will defend it.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>I will not let anybody think that they can privatize it.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>But we're going to have to make sure that we shore it up so that it is there not just for those who are currently recipients but for generations to come.”

For 80 years, Social Security has been America at its best.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Social Security reflects our shared belief that every American should be able to retire with dignity after decades of hard work.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>That no American should face poverty because he or she is disabled, or when a loved one dies.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>That we all have an obligation to each other.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Social Security isn't just a program—it's a promise.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>As president, Hillary will:

Defend Social Security against Republican attacks.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Republicans are using scare tactics about the future and effectiveness of Social Security to push through policies that would jeopardize it.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>The real threat is Republican attempts to undermine the bedrock of the system.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Hillary believes that Social Security must remain what it has always been: a rock-solid benefit that seniors can always count on—not subject to the budget whims of Congress or to the fluctuations of the stock market.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>She fought Republican efforts to undermine Social Security when she was a senator and throughout her career, and she will fight them as president.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>As president, she would:

Expand Social Security for those who need it most and who are treated unfairly by the current system—including women who are widows and those who took significant time out of the paid workforce to take care of their children, aging parents, or ailing family members.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Social Security works well, but it should work better.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Hillary will fight to expand Social Security for those who need it most and who are treated unfairly today.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>For instance:

The poverty rate for widowed women 65 or older is nearly 90 percent higher than for other seniors—in part because when a spouse dies, families can face a steep benefit cut.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>For a two-earner couple, those benefit cuts can be as much as 50 percent.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Hillary believes that we have to change that by reducing how much Social Security benefits drop when a spouse dies, so that the loss of a spouse doesn’t mean financial hardship or falling into poverty.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Millions of women—and men—take time out of the paid workforce to raise a child, take care of an aging parent or look after an ailing family member.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Caregiving is hard work that benefits our entire economy.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>However, when Americans take time off to take care of a relative, that can reduce their Social Security benefits at retirement, since those benefits are calculated based on their top thirty-five years of earnings.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>No one should face meager Social Security checks because they took on the vital role of caregiver for part of their career.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Americans should receive credit toward their Social Security benefits when they are out of the paid workforce because they are acting as caregivers.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Preserve Social Security for decades to come by asking the wealthiest to contribute more.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Social Security must continue to guarantee dignity in retirement for future generations.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Hillary understands that there is no way to accomplish that goal without asking the highest-income Americans to pay more, including options to tax some of their income above the current Social Security cap, and taxing some of their income not currently taken into account by the Social Security system.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Medicare is the bedrock of coverage for more than 50 million American seniors and people with disabilities.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Hillary has fought to protect and strengthen Medicare throughout her career, and she won't stop in this campaign.</font><br /><font color = #545457>As senator, Hillary co-sponsored and sponsored bills to reduce the impact of the Medicare prescription drug gap by reducing the price of pharmaceuticals for seniors.</font><br /><font color = #545457>As president, Hillary will defend against the efforts to end Medicare as we know it by privatizing Medicare or even to “phase out” the program.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Fight Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act that would raise costs and limit coverage for seniors.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Republicans in Congress have voted more than 50 times to repeal or dismantle the Affordable Care Act, and on the campaign trail, candidate after candidate has put forward plans to roll it back.</font><br /><font color = #545457>The Affordable Care Act made preventive care available without cost sharing to an estimated 39 million people with Medicare.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>It also began to close the drug coverage gap, or “donut hole,” saving more than 9 million people with Medicare an average of almost $1,600 per person.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Seniors and people with Medicare coverage cannot afford repealing the ACA.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Fight back against Republican plans to privatize or “phase out” Medicare as we know it.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Republicans have called for privatizing or even “phasing out” Medicare, and shifting millions more seniors into private plans that can segment the program and lead to a “death spiral” that dramatically raises costs for those relying on basic Medicare and thus undermining the basic Medicare guarantee.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Hillary Clinton will stand strongly against these attempts to weaken the program.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Drive down drug costs for seniors and other Americans.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>A typical senior spends over $500 per year out of his or her own pocket on prescription drugs.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Hillary’s plan will drive down drug costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower prices with drug and biologic manufacturers; demanding higher rebates; and allowing Americans to import lower-cost drugs from foreign countries with approved safety standards.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Her plan will encourage drug companies that get ahead by investing in life-saving treatments, rather than jacking up prices without innovating.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>The changes and reduced payments or higher rebates to drug companies will strengthen Medicare by saving more than $100 billion in program spending.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Medicare delivery system reforms that will deliver value and quality to our seniors and people with disabilities.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Hillary’s plan will continue to reward quality and improve value in Medicare by building on delivery system reforms that began as initiatives and pilot projects under the Affordable Care Act.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>For example, her plan will encourage the expansion of payment systems that pay for an entire episode of care or “bundle,” rather than the traditional “fee for service” payments, and those that incentivize doctors and hospitals to coordinate care in an Accountable Care Organization, so that providers are responsible for offering the best possible care at the highest value to patients.</font><br /><font color = #545457>These delivery reforms will provide higher quality at lower costs to people in Medicare, and Clinton’s plan will work to expand them to other parts of our health system so every American can benefit.</font><br /><h1>Bernie</h1><font color = #A9A9AD>Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation’s history.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Before it was signed into law, nearly half of senior citizens lived in poverty.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Today, the elderly poverty rate is 10 percent.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Although still much too high, that’s a dramatic improvement.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Through good times and bad, Social Security has paid every nickel owed to every eligible American – on time and without delay.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>As corporations destroyed the retirement dreams of millions over the past 30 years by eliminating defined benefit pension plans, Social Security was right there paying full benefits.</font><br /><font color = #545457>As millions of Americans lost their life savings after Wall Street’s recklessness crashed the economy in 2008, Social Security was right there paying full benefits.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Today, Social Security is more important than ever.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Over half of workers between the ages of 55-64 have no retirement savings.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>More than a third of senior citizens depend on Social Security for virtually all of their income.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>One out of every five senior citizens is trying to scrape by on an average income of just $8,300 a year.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Given these facts, our job cannot be to cut Social Security.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Our job must be to expand it so that every American can retire with dignity and respect.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Virtually every Republican candidate for president disagrees.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Many of them claim Social Security is “going broke,” that it’s causing the deficit to explode, and its trust fund is full of IOUs.</font><br /><font color = #949497>They want the American people to believe Social Security is in crisis and must be cut.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Here are the facts:

Sen. Sanders has introduced legislation to end this absurdity, by lifting this cap so that everyone who makes over $250,000 a year pays the same percentage of their income into Social Security as the middle class and working families.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>This would not only extend the solvency of Social Security for the next 50 years, but also bring in enough revenue to expand benefits by an average of $65 a month; increase cost-of-living-adjustments; and lift more seniors out of poverty by increasing the minimum benefits paid to low-income seniors.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Not only is this the right thing to do from a moral perspective, it is also what the vast majority of the American people want us to do.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>61 percent of the American people support expanding Social Security benefits by lifting the cap on taxable income, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll earlier this year.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>At a time when millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, even as virtually all of the new income in this country is going to the top one percent, Sen. Sanders’ legislation will begin to reduce the obscene level of income inequality in America.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>It’s time to expand Social Security to make sure that everyone in this country can retire with the dignity and respect they deserve.</font><br />
