<h1>Hillary</h1><font color = #BEBEC3>America’s long struggle with race is far from finished.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>“We can’t hide from any of these hard truths about race and justice in America.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>We have to name them, and own them, and then change them.”

The story of America is a story of progress.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>But more than a half a century after Dr. King voiced his dream for a more equal America, and civil rights activists marched and died for the right to vote, America’s struggle with racism remains far from finished.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Race still plays a role in determining who gets ahead in America—and who gets left behind.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Hillary knows that racial inequality is not merely a symptom of economic inequality.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>We need to address both.</font><br /><font color = #949497>As president, Hillary will fight to break down all the barriers that hold Americans back and build ladders of opportunity for all people.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>In too many communities, student discipline is overly harsh, with too large an emphasis on suspension, expulsion, or even police involvement—disproportionately impacting students of color and those with the greatest economic, social, and academic needs.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Hillary will work to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline by providing $2 billion in support to schools to reform overly punitive disciplinary policies, calling on states to reform school disturbance laws, and encouraging states to use federal education funding to implement social and emotional support interventions.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>End the era of mass incarceration.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>America’s criminal justice system is out of balance.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Keeping nonviolent offenders behind bars does little to reduce crime, but it does a lot to tear apart families and communities.</font><br /><font color = #545457>One in every 28 children now has a parent in prison, 1.5 million African American men are missing from their communities, and Native Americans are incarcerated at a rate 38 percent higher than the national average.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Hillary will work to cut mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses in half, apply the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactively, and eliminate the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>She will prioritize treatment and rehabilitation—rather than incarceration—for low-level, nonviolent drug offenders.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>And she will end the privatization of our prisons.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Read more: Hillary’s remarks on criminal justice and mass incarceration at Columbia University.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Strengthen bonds of trust between communities and police.</font><br /><font color = #545457>African American men are far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men found guilty of the same offenses.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>From Ferguson to Staten Island to Baltimore, the patterns have become unmistakable and undeniable.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Black lives matter.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Everyone in this country should stand firmly behind that.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Hillary believes that effective policing and constitutional policing go hand-in-hand—we can and must do both.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>As president, Hillary will invest in law enforcement training programs on issues such as implicit bias, use of force, and de-escalation.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>She will also create national guidelines for use of force, provide federal matching funds to make body cameras available to every police department in America, and support legislation to ban racial profiling by federal, state, and local law enforcement officials.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Read more: 9 things you should know about Hillary Clinton’s plan to reform our criminal justice system.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Protect the right to vote.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Hillary has laid out her vision to help more Americans exercise their right to vote and defend against the systematic, deliberate efforts to stop millions from participating in our democracy.</font><br /><font color = #545457>As president, she will fight to repair the Voting Rights Act and implement universal, automatic voter registration so that every American will be registered to vote when they turn 18, unless they opt out.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Protect immigrants’ rights and keep families together.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>America’s immigrants continue to earn lower wages, lag behind in education achievement, and face discrimination in their lives.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>And millions of undocumented immigrants—the majority Latino and AAPI—live in constant fear that deportation will tear their families apart.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Hillary will fight for comprehensive immigration reform, including a full and equal pathway to citizenship.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>She will conduct humane, targeted enforcement, including by ending family detention and closing private immigrant detention centers.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Read

communities.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Gun violence is the leading cause of death for young African American men—more than the next nine leading causes combined.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Hillary believes we must do more to crack down on gun stores that flood our communities with illegal guns and deprive our children of their futures.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>That is why she will stand up to the gun lobby and work to build on President Obama’s common sense reforms.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Fight environmental injustice.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Clean air and clean water are basic human rights—they shouldn’t vary between ZIP codes.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Yet, too many children in low-income housing are exposed to lead, African American children are twice as likely to suffer from asthma as white children, half of Latinos live in areas where the air quality does not meet EPA's health standards—and climate change will put vulnerable populations at even greater risk.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>As president, Hillary will make environmental justice a priority by working to reduce air pollution, investing in the removal of toxins like lead, developing greener and more resilient infrastructure, tackling energy poverty, and boosting efforts to clean up highly polluted toxic sites.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Close the education achievement gap.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Every child—in every ZIP code—deserves the opportunity to live up to his or her potential.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>That begins with a world class education from birth through college.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Hillary will double America’s investment in Early Head Start and ensure that every four year old in America has access to high-quality preschool to begin closing the achievement gap.</font><br /><font color = #949497>She will modernize and elevate the teaching profession to drive student achievement in our K-12 schools.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>And her college plan will make college affordable and relieve the crushing burden of student debt.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>End violence against the transgender community—particularly women of color.</font><br /><font color = #949497>LGBT Americans, particularly transgender women of color, are disproportionately the targets of discrimination, harassment, and violence.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>As president, Hillary will fight for full LGBT equality.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>She will will work to protect transgender individuals from violence by improving the reporting of hate crimes, investing in law enforcement training that promotes fair and impartial interactions with the LGBT community, and directing the government to collect better data regarding crime victims.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Revitalize the economy in communities being left out and left behind.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>It’s unacceptable that so many African American families live in pockets of extreme poverty and that so many African American youths are unable to secure a good job.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Hillary’s Economic Revitalization Initiative will invest $125 billion to create good-paying jobs, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and connect housing to opportunity in communities that have been neglected for too long: $50 billion to create millions of new jobs and provide pathways of opportunity.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>As president, Hillary will work to create jobs in communities that are being left out.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Her plan includes $20 billion to create youth jobs, particularly for African American, Native American, and Latino youth; $5 billion to create reentry programs that will help formerly incarcerated Americans get back on their feet when they return to society; and $25 billion to support entrepreneurship and small business growth in underserved communities.</font><br /><font color = #949497>$50 billion in infrastructure investments to connect working families to good-paying jobs and opportunity.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Too many Americans are trapped in so-called “opportunity deserts,” where a lack of reliable transportation keeps them from accessing good-paying jobs.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>As president, Hillary will make significant investments in public transit to connect the unemployed and underemployed to jobs they need.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>She will also rebuild crumbling water systems to preserve public health and create jobs and opportunity for local residents and small businesses.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>$25 billion to remove blight from neighborhoods, remove barriers to sustainable homeownership, and connect affordable housing to economic opportunity.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Centuries of housing discrimination have excluded people of color from the mainstream mortgage market and cut families off from communities with high-performing schools, safe streets, and good-paying jobs.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Hillary will fight to ensure that housing policy and the housing market serve to connect every family to economic opportunity, rather than exclude them.</font><br /><font color = #949497>And she’ll empower communities to overcome pockets of blight and give local businesses a chance to flourish.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Hillary has been fighting for racial justice her entire career:

As a young lawyer working for the Children’s Defense Fund, Hillary went to South Carolina to work to stop the incarceration of teenagers in adult prisons, and she investigated school segregation in Alabama at so-called “private academies.” In Arkansas, she started a legal aid clinic to ensure that poor people had access to real legal representation; she helped start a program to help low income parents prepare their kids for school success, which is now in more than 20 states; and she helped to found the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, which helped nearly 40,000 single parents with their education.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>As first lady, she continued her advocacy for children and families, helping to pass the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which now covers more than 8 million kids, helping reform the foster care and adoption system, and advocating for the expansion of Medicaid to cover foster kids until they are 21.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>She pushed for the expansion of Head Start and for breaking barriers for working parents like quality child care and equal pay for women.</font><br /><font color = #545457>As a U.S. senator, she worked to improve pre-K programs and provide parenting help for at-risk families, which is now part of the Affordable Care Act, and she pushed to expand CHIP to cover more kids.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>She co-sponsored legislation to end racial profiling and implement sentencing reforms to address crack-cocaine disparities.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>She also fought to restore voting rights for individuals involved in the criminal justice system, expand programs that help people re-enter society when they have served their time, and worked to expand assistance for at-risk kids including intervention and treatment.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>She also introduced comprehensive legislation to protect voting rights; supported increased funding for HIV/AIDS programs, spotlighting the disproportionate impact on African American women; and worked with then Senator Obama to fight against lead poisoning, holding the first hearing on environmental justice and disparate impacts on the African American community.</font><br /><h1>Bernie</h1><font color = #A9A9AD>We must pursue policies to transform this country into a nation that affirms the value of its people of color.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>That starts with addressing the five central types of violence waged against black, brown and indigenous Americans: physical, political, legal, economic and environmental.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Jessica Hernandez, Tamir Rice, Jonathan Ferrell, Oscar Grant, Antonio Zambrano-Montes, Samuel DuBose and Anastacio Hernandez-Rojas.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>We know their names.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Each of them died unarmed at the hands of police officers or in police custody.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>The chants are growing louder.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>People are angry and they have a right to be angry.</font><br /><font color = #949497>We should not fool ourselves into thinking that this violence only affects those whose names have appeared on TV or in the newspaper.</font><br /><font color = #545457>African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>African-American and Latinos comprise well over half of all prisoners, even though African-Americans and Latinos make up approximately one quarter of the total US population.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>We are far from eradicating racism in this country.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Today in America, if you are black, you can be killed for getting a pack of Skittles during a basketball game.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Or murdered in your church while you are praying.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>This violence fills us with outrage, disgust and a deep, deep sadness.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>These hateful acts of violence amount to acts of terror.</font><br /><font color = #949497>They are perpetrated by extremists who want to intimidate and terrorize black, brown and indigenous people in this country.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>It is an outrage that in these early years of the 21st century we are seeing intolerable acts of violence being perpetrated by police and racist acts of terrorism by white supremacists.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>A growing number of communities do not trust the police.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Law enforcement officers have become disconnected from the communities they are sworn to protect.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Violence and brutality of any kind, particularly at the hands of the police meant to protect and serve our communities, is unacceptable and must not be tolerated.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>We need a societal transformation to make it clear that black lives matter and racism will not be accepted in a civilized country.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>In the shameful days of open segregation, literacy laws and poll taxes were used to suppress minority voting.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Today, through other laws and actions — such as requiring voters to show photo ID, discriminatory drawing of Congressional districts, restricting same-day registration and early voting and aggressively purging voter rolls — states are taking steps which have a similar effect.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>The patterns are unmistakable.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>11 percent of eligible voters do not have a photo ID—and they are disproportionately black and Latino.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>In 2012, African-Americans waited twice as long to vote as whites.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Some voters in minority precincts waited upwards of six or seven hours to cast a ballot.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Meanwhile, thirteen percent of African-American men have lost the right to vote due to felony convictions.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Yet in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the seminal Voting Rights Act, even while saying “voting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.”

This should offend the conscience of every American.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>The fight for minority voting rights is a fight for justice.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>It is inseparable from the struggle for democracy itself.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Millions of lives have been destroyed because people are in jail for nonviolent crimes.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>For decades, we have been engaged in a failed “War on Drugs” with racially-biased mandatory minimums that punish people of color unfairly.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>It is an obscenity that we stigmatize so many young Americans with a criminal record for smoking marijuana, but not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>This must change.</font><br /><font color = #545457>If current trends continue, one in four black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Blacks are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites and a report by the Department of Justice found that blacks were three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop, compared to white motorists.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Together, African-Americans and Latinos comprised 57 percent of all prisoners in 2014, even though African-Americans and Latinos make up approximately one quarter of the US population.</font><br /><font color = #949497>These outcomes are not reflective of increased crime by communities of color, but rather a disparity in enforcement and reporting mechanisms.</font><br /><font color = #545457>African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>This is an unspeakable tragedy.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>It is morally repugnant that we have privatized prisons all over America.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Corporations should not be allowed to make a profit by building more jails and keeping more Americans behind bars.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>We have got to end the private for-profit prison racket in America.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Earlier this year, Sen. Sanders introduced legislation that will end the private prison industry.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>The measure of success for law enforcement should not be how many people get locked up.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>We need to invest in drug courts as well as medical and mental health interventions for people with substance abuse problems, so that people struggling with addiction do not end up in prison, they end up in treatment.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>For people who have committed crimes that have landed them in jail, there needs to be a path back from prison.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>The federal system of parole needs to be reinstated.</font><br /><font color = #949497>We need real education and real skills training for the incarcerated.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>We must end the over-incarceration of nonviolent young Americans who do not pose a serious threat to our society.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>It is an international embarrassment that we have more people locked up in jail than any other country on earth – more than even the Communist totalitarian state of China.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>That has got to end.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>We must address the lingering unjust stereotypes that lead to the labeling of black youths as “thugs” and “super predators.” We know the truth that, like every community in this country, the vast majority of people of color are trying to work hard, play by the rules and raise their children.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>It’s time to stop demonizing minority communities.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>In many cities all over our country, the incentives for policing are upside down.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Departments are bringing in substantial sums of revenue by seizing the personal property of people who are suspected of criminal involvement.</font><br /><font color = #545457>So-called civil asset forfeiture laws allow police to take property from people even before they are charged with a crime, much less convicted of one.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Even worse, the system works in a way that makes it very difficult and expensive for an innocent person to get his or her property back.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>We must end programs that actually reward officials for seizing assets without a criminal conviction or other lawful mandate.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Departments and officers should not profit off of such seizures.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Local governments that rely on tickets and fines to pay bills can become dependent on implicit quotas for law enforcement.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>When policing is a source of revenue tied to the financial sustainability of agencies, officers are pressured to meet internal goals which can lead to unnecessary or unlawful traffic stops and citations which disproportionately affect people of color.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Implicit quota systems promote racial stereotyping and breed distrust between officers and communities of color.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Furthermore, we must ensure police departments are not abusing avenues of due process to shield bad actors from accountability.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Local governments and police management must show zero tolerance for abuses of police power at all levels.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>All employees of any kind deserve due process protections, but it must be clear that departments will vigorously investigate and, if necessary, prosecute every allegation of wrongdoing to the fullest extent.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Weeks before his death, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke to a union group in New York about what he called “the other America.”

“One America is flowing with the milk of prosperity and the honey of equality,” King said.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>“That America is the habitat of millions of people who have food and material necessities for their bodies, culture and education for their minds, freedom and human dignity for their spirits … But as we assemble here tonight, I’m sure that each of us is painfully aware of the fact that there is another America and that other America has a daily ugliness about it that transforms the buoyancy of hope into the fatigue of despair.”

The problem was structural, King said: “This country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.”

But what King saw in 1968 — and what we all should recognize today — is that it is necessary to try to address the rampant economic inequality while also taking on the issue of societal racism.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>We must simultaneously address the structural and institutional racism which exists in this country, while at the same time we vigorously attack the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which is making the very rich much richer while everyone else — especially those in our minority communities – are becoming poorer.</font><br /><font color = #545457>In addition to the physical violence faced by too many in our country we need to look at the lives of black children and address some difficult facts.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Black children, who make up just 18 percent of preschoolers, account for 48 percent of all out-of-school suspensions before kindergarten.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>We are failing our black children before kindergarten.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Black students are expelled at three times the rate of white students.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Black girls are suspended at higher rates than all other girls and most boys.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>According to the Department of Education, African-American students are more likely to suffer harsh punishments — suspensions and arrests — at school.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Black students attend schools with higher concentrations of first-year teachers when compared with white students.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Black students are more than three times as likely to attend schools where fewer than 60 percent of teachers meet all state certification and licensure requirements.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Communities of color also face the violence of economic deprivation.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Let’s be frank: neighborhoods like those in west Baltimore, where Freddie Gray resided, suffer the most.</font><br /><font color = #545457>However, the problem of economic immobility isn’t just a problem for young men like Freddie Gray.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Despite hard-work and the will to get ahead, millions of Americans spend their entire lives struggling to survive on the economic treadmill.</font><br /><font color = #949497>We live at a time when most Americans have less than $10,000 in savings and millions of working adults have no idea how they will ever retire in dignity.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>An unforeseen car accident, a medical emergency, or the loss of a job could send their lives into an economic tailspin.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>And the problems are even more serious when we consider race.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Let us not forget: It was the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street that nearly drove the economy off of a cliff seven years ago.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>While millions of Americans lost their jobs, homes, life savings and ability to send their kids to college, African-Americans who were steered into expensive subprime mortgages were the hardest hit.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Most black and Latino households have less than $350 in savings.</font><br /><font color = #545457>The black unemployment rate has remained roughly twice as high as the white rate over the last 40 years, regardless of education.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Real African-American youth unemployment is over 50 percent.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>African-American women earn 64 cents for every dollar white men make.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>This is unacceptable.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>The American people in general want change — they want a better deal.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>A fairer deal.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>A new deal.</font><br /><font color = #949497>They want an America with laws and policies that truly reward hard work with economic mobility.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>They want an America that affords all of its citizens with the economic security to take risks and the opportunity to realize their full potential.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>People of color disproportionately experience a daily assault on their health and environment.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Communities of color are the hardest hit by air and water pollution from industrial factories, power plants, incinerators, chemical waste and lead contamination from old pipes and paint.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>At the same time, they lack access to parks, gardens and other recreational green space.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Like income inequality, environmental inequality is rapidly growing in the United States.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Black children are five times more likely than white children to have lead poisoning.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Indigenous peoples are impacted disproportionately by destructive mining practices and the dumping of hazardous materials on their lands.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>As demonstrated by Hurricane Katrina, poor communities of color have a harder time escaping, surviving and recovering from climate-related disasters.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Taken together, it is clear that people of color experience a disparate exposure to environmental hazards where they “work, live, and play.”

Nationwide, the health of communities is consistently ignored in favor of the profits of corporate polluters.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>The fact that people of color breathe 46 percent more nitrogen dioxide —which causes respiratory diseases and heart conditions — than whites helps explain why one in six African-American kids has asthma.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>The environmental violence being inflicted on people of color who are denied the full rights of citizenship — especially migrant workers and new immigrants — is especially pronounced.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Low-income Latino immigrants are more likely to live in areas with high levels of hazardous air pollution than anyone else.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>In fact, the odds of a Latino immigrant neighborhood being located in an area of high toxic pollution is one in three.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Latinos and African-Americans are more likely to work in hazardous jobs that place them at higher risk for serious occupational diseases, injuries and muscular-skeletal disabilities.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>The fatality rate among Latino workers is 23 percent higher than the fatal injury rate for all US workers.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Often reluctant to complain about poor working conditions for fear of deportation or being fired, Mexican migrant workers are nearly twice as likely as the rest of the immigrant population to die at work.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>This is unacceptable and must be addressed.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Taken together, these injustices are largely the product of political marginalization and institutional racism.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>The less political power a community of color possesses, the more likely they are to experience insidious environmental and human health threats.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>The environmental violence being inflicted on these communities of color is taking a terrible toll, and must be made a national priority.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Access to a clean and healthy environment is a fundamental right of citizenship.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>To deny such rights constitutes an environmental injustice that should never be tolerated.</font><br />
