<h1>Hillary</h1><font color = #3F3F41>“Our banking system is still too complex and too risky … While institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences – or none at all, even when they’ve already pocketed the gains.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>This is wrong, and on my watch, it will change.”

The financial crisis showed how irresponsible behavior in the financial sector can devastate the lives of everyday Americans—costing 9 million workers their jobs, driving 5 million families out of their homes, and wiping out more than $13 trillion in household wealth.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Hillary has a plan to reduce the risk of future crises and make our financial system fairer and more accountable.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Hillary’s plan will tackle dangerous risks in the financial system: 



Impose a risk fee on the largest financial institutions.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Banks and financial companies would be required to pay a fee based on their size and their risk of contributing to another financial crisis.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Close the Volcker Rule’s hedge fund loophole.</font><br /><font color = #545457>The Volcker Rule prohibits banks from making risky trading bets with taxpayer-backed money—one of the core protections of the post-financial crisis Wall Street reforms.</font><br /><font color = #949497>However, under current law these banks can still invest billions through hedge funds, which are exempt from this rule.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Hillary would close that loophole and strengthen the law.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Discourage excessive risk-taking by making senior bankers accountable.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Senior managers should lose some or all of their bonus compensation when a large bank suffers losses that threaten its overall financial health.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Make sure no firm is ever too big and too risky to be managed effectively.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Hillary’s plan would give regulators more authority to force overly complex or risky firms to reorganize, downsize, or break apart.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Tackle financial dangers of the “shadow banking” system.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Hillary’s plan will enhance transparency and reduce volatility in the “shadow banking system,” which includes certain activities of hedge funds, investment banks, and other non-bank financial companies.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Impose a tax on high-frequency trading.</font><br /><font color = #545457>The growth of high-frequency trading has unnecessarily placed stress on our markets, created instability, and enabled unfair and abusive trading strategies.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Hillary would impose a tax on harmful high-frequency trading and reform rules to make our stock markets fairer, more open, and transparent.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Hillary would also hold both corporations and individuals on Wall Street accountable by:

Prosecuting individuals when they break the law.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Hillary would extend the statute of limitations for prosecuting major financial frauds, enhance whistleblower rewards, and provide the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission more resources to prosecute wrongdoing.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>Holding executives accountable when they are responsible for their subordinates’ misconduct.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Hillary believes that when corporations pay large fines to the government for violating the law, those fines should cut into the bonuses of the executives who were responsible for or should have caught the problem.</font><br /><font color = #949497>And when egregious misconduct happens on an executive’s watch, that executive should lose his or her job.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Holding corporations accountable when they break the law.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>As she enhances individual accountability, Hillary will make sure that corporations don’t treat penalties for breaking the law as merely a cost of doing business, so that we can put an end to the patterns of corporate wrongdoing that we see too often today.</font><br /><h1>Bernie</h1><font color = #3F3F41>Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial decisions while expecting the public to bail it out.</font><br /><font color = #545457>The six largest financial institutions in this country today hold assets equal to about 60% of the nation’s gross domestic product.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>These six banks issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and over 35% of all mortgages.</font><br /><font color = #949497>They control 95% of all derivatives and hold more than 40% of all bank deposits in the United States.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>We must break up too-big-to-fail financial institutions.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>Those institutions received a $700 billion bailout from the US taxpayer, and more than $16 trillion in virtually zero interest loans from the Federal Reserve.</font><br /><font color = None>Despite that, financial institutions made over $152 billion in profit in 2014 – the most profitable year on record, and three of the four largest financial institutions are 80% bigger today than they were before we bailed them out.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>‎

Our banking system must be part of the productive, job-creating economy.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>The Federal Reserve, a government entity which serves as the engine of the banking industry, must eliminate its internal conflicts of interest, provide stricter oversight, and insist that the banks serve the economy in a way that works for everyone, not just a few.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>These institutions have acquired too much economic and political power, endangering our economy and our political process.</font><br />
