<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>Political candidates often present information about themselves and their
proposed policies on their websites. However, it isn't always easy to compare
different candidates or find the most important information on these websites.
This is an example of me trying to begin to think about how we could use
technology to start to address these questions by comparing the two frontrunners
in the Democratic race: Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.</p>
<h1>What am I looking at?</h1>
<p>Below is a list of links to issues. If you go to an issue page, you'll find two
sections â€” one for each candidate. The text there is text extracted from that
candidate's website about the given issue. The way it's currently formatted is
each line is a sentence. The color of that sentence is supposed to correspond to
how unique that sentence is and how well it distinguishes one candidate from the
other. Darker sentences do a better job of distinguishing than lighter ones.
This is to say, if you want to skim the text, the sentences in a darker font
should be the ones you pay attention to to help you understand what makes each
candidate unique.</p>
<h1>How does this work?</h1>
<p>First, we parse each candidate's issue page (see
<a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/">Bernie</a> and
<a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/">Hillary</a>) and we identify the major
issues they discuss and extract those. Currently, we use only the names of the
issues to try to find overlap between the candidates. For example, Hillary talks
about "Climate change and energy" and Bernie talks about "Combating Climate
Change to Save the Planet." Since these both contain the phrase "Climate
Change," we assume they refer to the same issue. The current implementation
doesn't always exactly work out. Hillary talks broadly about "Economy" whereas
Bernie talks about "Improving the Rural Economy." Currently, we match these,
even though they're not exactly the same, so afterwards we manually remove this
match. Ideally, we'd improve matching so no intervention was required. There are
a couple of other issues with the current implementation. We only look for one
best match. Hillary has one issue called "Social Security and Medicare." Bernie
has both "Strengthen and Expand Social Security" and "Medicare For All." Our
current approach will end up ignoring "Medicate For All" since Hillary's issue
has already been matched to Bernie's Social Security issue. We also ignore
matches we're not confident in. The string matching algorithm doesn't report a
high confidence in matching Hillary's "Veterans, the armed forces, and their
families" and Bernie's "Caring for Our Veterans," even though to a human this is
obviously a match. Future work should address these problems.</p>
<p>After we find matching issues, we scrape the text from each candidate's issue
page for that issue. We then try to break this text into sentences. Then we use
a fairly simplistic approach based on word frequency across sentences to assign
a score to each sentence. A higher score for a sentence means it contains more
unique words. These words are unique both within a candidate's issue page and
compared to the other candidate. For example, part of what makes the phrase
"Global Equality Fund" important is that it's not mentioned in a lot of
sentences by Hillary Clinton <em>or</em> by Bernie Sanders. Therefore, when Hillary
Clinton does use a sentence that contains this phrase, it is likely to receive a
high score.</p>
<p>After scoring all the sentences for a candidate, we compare the score to the
scores of all other sentences in that issue. Based on how high or low the score
is compared to the rest of the scores, we assign a color to the sentence.
Sentences that are completely black are those that had a score that was in the
90th percentile of scores for that candidate on that issue.</p>
