<h1>Hillary</h1><font color = #E8E8EE>We must continue to expand opportunities for all Americans.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>“We should acknowledge how the disabilities community has played such an important role in changing things for the better in our country.”

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was a tremendous step forward.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>It opened educational opportunities to all Americans, expanded transportation, made sure everyone can enter buildings, and ensured that no one would be turned down for a job because of a disability.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Hillary is committed to realizing the promise of the ADA and continuing to expand opportunity for all Americans.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>Hillary has spent her life fighting for the rights of Americans with disabilities.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Hillary’s first job out of law school was with the Children’s Defense Fund, and one of her first tasks was going door to door to figure out why so many children were missing school.</font><br /><font color = #949497>She discovered that many parents were not sending their children to school because schools did not accommodate disabilities.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>The evidence she helped gather was presented to Congress, and built the case for passage of the law that ensures all children with disabilities have access to school.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>As secretary of state, Hillary worked to build strong support for the United States to join the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</font><br /><font color = #BEBEC3>But despite a broad, bipartisan coalition, the Republican-controlled Senate blocked its passage.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Now, 25 years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Hillary recognizes that there is still much work to do, including improving access to meaningful and gainful employment for people with disabilities.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Too many Americans with disabilities continue to be left out of the workforce, and for those who are employed, too many are in under-stimulating jobs that don't fully allow them to use their talents.</font><br /><h1>Bernie</h1><font color = #BEBEC3>When the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was passed 25 years ago, it was hailed as the world’s first comprehensive declaration of equality for people with disabilities.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>Today, as a result of this landmark legislation, millions of people with disabilities are no longer denied the opportunity to get on a bus, go to a decent school, make a decent living, attend a baseball game, and live successful and productive lives.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>Instead of being isolated and hidden from society, kids with disabilities are now in classrooms all over America and graduating from high school and college with the respect and admiration of their classmates, teachers, and families.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>This transformation in our culture and society did not happen by accident, and it did not happen overnight – it happened because a grassroots movement demanded change.</font><br /><font color = #69696C>Despite the progress that has been made over the past two decades, we unfortunately still live in a world where people with disabilities have fewer work opportunities and where the civil rights of people with disabilities are not always protected and respected.</font><br /><font color = #949497>Bernie has been a champion for the rights of people with disabilities and he will continue to fight to ensure that our society is one where people with disabilities can live full and productive lives.</font><br /><font color = #E8E8EE>Nearly one-in-five Americans have a disability.</font><br /><font color = #545457>Disability may occur at any stage of life, to anyone, and how our government and elected leadership respond to the issues facing people with disabilities and their families – from housing and transportation, to autonomy, to employment and education and access to services – shapes the fabric of our society.</font><br /><font color = #7F7F82>At a time when millions of disabled Americans are struggling to keep their heads above water economically, Bernie believes that we must expand the social safety net in this country so that every American can live in dignity.</font><br /><font color = #2A2A2B>As the lead Democrat on the Budget Committee, Bernie fought against the Republican budget that would make lives much more difficult for persons with disabilities by throwing 27 million Americans off of health insurance, cutting Medicaid by $500 billion, turning Medicare into a voucher program, and making savage cuts in education, affordable housing, vocational assistance, and nutrition programs.</font><br /><font color = #3F3F41>Instead of slashing Medicaid, instead of privatizing Medicare, Bernie believes what the United States must do is join every other major nation on earth and recognize that health care is a right of citizenship for every American, regardless of age.</font><br /><font color = D3D3D8>That’s why Bernie is fighting for a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care plan for every man, woman, and child in this country.</font><br /><font color = #A9A9AD>As Franklin Delano Roosevelt reminded us: “The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.” And that is a test that we as a nation must once again meet and master.</font><br />
