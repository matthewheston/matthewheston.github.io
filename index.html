    <b>Hi, I'm Matthew.</b> I'm a PhD student at Northwestern University in 
    <a href="http://tsb.northwestern.edu">Technology and Social Behavior</a>, a 
    joint degree in Computer Science and Communication Studies.  I work in the <a
    href="http://socialmedia.northwestern.edu">Social Media Lab</a> which is
    directed by Professor Jeremy Birnholtz. I conduct multi-methods research
    broadly in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Computer-Mediated
    Communication. You can find out more about my work on my <a
    href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x50m964f3niddor/Heston_CV.pdf?dl=0">CV</a> and
    find links to my publications on the <a
    href="http://socialmedia.northwestern.edu/publications/">SML publications
    page.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Before coming to Northwestern, I graduated with an M.S. in Information
    Architecture from the <a href="http://humansciences.iit.edu/">Lewis College of
    Human Sciences at the Illinois Institute of Technology</a>, where I worked in
    the <a href="http://casmlab.org/">Collaboration and Social Media Lab</a> with
    <a href="http://libbyh.com/">Professor Libby Hemphill</a>. I also spent a
    summer as a fellow in <a href="http://dssg.uchicago.edu/">The Eric & Wendy
    Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Fellowship</a> at the University of Chicago.

    I occasionally <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewheston">tweet</a> and <a
    href="https://github.com/matthewheston/">write code</a>. I also perform
    improvisational comedy at a few different places around Chicago.  If you'd
    like to get in touch, please feel free to send me an <a
